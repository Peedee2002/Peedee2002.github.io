I developed product features using a Java micro-service back-end and Angular.js front-end with review and testing. I also developed an
internal tool written in React and Express for observing environment health and status.

I saved hours of manual testing time, and saved hours of outage diagnosis time during incidents involving the team. I
also managed back-end, front-end, and deployment of this full stack application to AWS. I also refactored large Java projects for more
efficient deployments to better leverage serverless tools on AWS.

More importantly however, this was my first full-time job. ResMed taught me the way a sprint work, how to review, and how to recieve reviews in a professional setting. I also learned javascript, react and angularJS on the job, teaching me how to learn and iterate quickly on new concepts. I was able to do it with the guidance of smart and patient software engineers at all levels at ResMed.
