I developed product features using a Java micro-service back-end and Angular.js front-end with thorough review and testing processes. I also developed an
internal tool written in React and Express for observing environment health and status.

I saved hours of manual testing time, and saved hours of outage diagnosis time during incidents involving the team. I
also managed back-end, front-end, and deployment of this full stack application to AWS. I also refactored large Java projects for more
efficient deployments to better leverage serverless tools on AWS. The project would fail due to memory or resourcing issues previously, but now no longer suffers these problems as our datasets scaled.

More importantly however, this was my first full-time job. ResMed taught me the way a sprint works, how to review other people's code, and how to receive reviews in a professional setting. I also learned JavaScript, React and angularJS on the job, teaching me how to learn and iterate quickly on new concepts. I was able to do it with the guidance of smart and patient software engineers at all levels at ResMed.
