I helped in the collection and analysis of data from applications ranging from the SMH, the Age, and 9Now. user events such as page views,
user stories and page events were triggered in a systematic way from various differing applications and tech stacks.

I also started and handed off a project over 1 month to re-architect a data team's infrastructure in GCP by leveraging Composer and
Docker, to support local development and to deliver cost savings and reliability improvements. This led to dramatic speedups in our
development iteration cycles, which would take at least 5 minutes previously. They were now a minute at most. This is the project I have
continued as a graduate engineer.

Most importantly, I got to meet some incredible engineers who were driven by both innovation and product improvement. I was inspired by the
work done at nine to balance the needs of the business to the needs of the engineers. I saw how to effectively communicate with people from
diverse fields.
